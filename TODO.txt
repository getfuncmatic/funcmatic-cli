TODO:

* More productive logging/monitoring (e.g. refine the paperclip plugin) 
* Have user sign in again if token is close to expired
* Implement 'silent' mode on all commands (allows better composition of commands?)
* Better formatting of CLI results rather than just return JSON API return values

----------
BACKLOG:

* BUG: remove version with alias errors out with 500 error (need to have better error message)
* Use inquirer to confirm if deleting entire function


----------

DONE:

* Update package so that it excludes development dependencies
* BUG: when deploying function the handler is set to 'wrapper.handler' instead of 'index.handler'
* BUG: when deploying function it is of type 'standard' instead of 'raw'
* BUG: Accessiblity is null when copy and not set to 'all'
* Try deploying a new cold function and see if it is immediately invokable
* Implement tag/untag to version
* Use tables to show versions
* Remove a specific version
* BUG: funcmatic invoke API raw sets event to be be { event, context } rather than just straight event
* Test using Funcmatic framework 
* Reverse version order and don't show $LATEST
* Implement "remove *" which removes all unaliases versions
* Support deploy DEV (which tags talias after successful deploy)
